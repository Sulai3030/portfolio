        <p>I am an aspiring Web Engineer with additional editorial content, book, blogging, recipe, and E-publishing experience.
            I have an MFA in Writing from The New School University in New York City and a Certificate in Publishing from
            Emerson College.
            <center>OLD RECIPES IN A NEW HOME!</center>

            <p>I used to write recipes for Examiner.com. I was the New York City Budget Meals Examiner. Essentially I wrote
                simple affordable meals for the busy average person with budget constraints. We didn’t really have rules
                so I set up my own, like most meals I created would cost between $50-$75 to buy all the ingredients and they
                would last a single person at least four days.

                <p>It was really fun creating meals on the fly and gave me a new hobby which I continue to this day. Plus we
                    had to take our own photos so I got seriously into photography. I’m still not great at it but it is another
                    past time that I have. Yes I’m one of those sunset photo takers.

                    <p>Well Examiner was taken down and I have to find a new place to post my recipes. No fear though on new
                        experiences. I will start reposting the old recipes here while I search out a new place to publish
                        new recipes.


                        <p>Fresh and Flavorful Pasta, Basil, Tomatoes Some of the best recipes are happy accidents. I was cleaning
                            my bedroom and clearing a stack of papers off my desk when I noticed that one of them had a handwritten
                            recipe on it. I have no idea where it came from but judging from the ingredients I was game to
                            eat. Initially I tried this recipe with linguine but decided to experiment with different pastas
                            when the grocery store near me had a sale. I found that Penne and Rigatoni’s ridges picked up
                            the spices and held onto the flavors better than the linguini did.
                            <ul>
                                <li>1lb Rigatoni or Penne
                                    <li>3 Tlb Olive oil
                                        <li>1 red onion diced
                                            <li>3 cloves fresh garlic smashed
                                                <li>4-5 Italian sausages casings removed (I prefer the Italian sausage because
                                                    the spices add to the flavor of the dish) 1 pint cherry tomatoes 2 Tlb
                                                    red wine vinegar 3/4 tsp kosher salt 1/4 tsp black pepper 1/4 cup arugula
                                                    1/2 cup fresh basil Parmesan to taste</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Cook pasta al dente and set aside.</p>
                            <p>Heat oil in a large sauce pan, add onions and garlic. Cook until onion is translucent. Add sausage
                                with the casing removed. (I just discovered that they don’t </p>sell the sausage filling
                            uncased and the price is competitive with that of the regular sausage.)</p>

                        <p>Add tomatoes and cook until they burst in the pan. Add vinegar, salt and pepper. </p>
                        <p>Mix well in the pan.</p>

                        <p>Add about half of the pasta to the pot. Mix. Add the Basil last. Turn off and </p>
                        <p>place half the pasta on top of some arugula.</p>

                        <p>Grate some fresh parmesan on top of the pasta mixture. Enjoy. This recipe is can’t miss! Mangia and
                            Enjoy!
