Focusing on a mobile platform, our team pulled in info using various APIs to gather helpful voter information such as polling location, voting dates, candidate info, and ballot questions into one place. Now, the average US voter can easily enter their zipcode and find their nearest polling location and its hours. Using various APIs and incumbent webpage info, we were able to bulild an app that aids voters in participating in their civic duty. G.O.A.T.
